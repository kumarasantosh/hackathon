# UNIVO+: Verified Topper Tutoring & Smart Study Group Matching

## Title of the Project

**UNIVO+: Verified Topper Tutoring & Smart Study Group Matching**

---

## Problem Statement (Short Form)

Students often struggle during semester exams due to lack of structured guidance and difficulty accessing high-quality resources. Coaching is costly, faculty time is limited, and unverified peer groups (WhatsApp/Telegram) lack credibility. Even though the same topics and questions repeat every semester, knowledge transfer between batches remains weak.

---

## Motivation Behind the Selected Problem

Toppers of every batch consistently excel because of their proven study methods, curated resources, and effective answers to frequently repeated exam questions. However, these valuable materials often remain limited to a small circle of friends. At the same time, many students want reliable study groups but fail to find peers with the same pace, subjects, or seriousness. By building a structured platform that connects verified toppers and students, and also matches learners into collaborative study groups, we can democratize access to quality exam preparation while making learning more engaging and affordable.

## Objective

To create a trusted academic platform where verified toppers (≥9 CGPA) share their study resources and provide tutoring sessions, while students can also connect with peers studying the same topics to form virtual or physical study groups. The platform ensures credibility, affordability, and reusability of knowledge semester after semester.

## Scope

### Core Features

* **Verified Topper Tutors:** Only students with ≥9 CGPA qualify as tutors, ensuring academic credibility.
* **Resource Sharing:** Toppers upload notes, past question solutions, and reference materials they personally used.
* **Affordable Micro-Tutoring:** Students can book small paid sessions with toppers for focused guidance (₹30–₹100/session or package deals).
* **AI Study Group Matching:** Students can find peers preparing for the same subject/topic and connect virtually or physically.
* **Reusable Knowledge Base:** Resources and solutions get stored semester after semester, building a growing library for future batches.
* **Smart Tools:** AI-powered quizzes, flashcards, and reminders for repeated questions.

### Key Differentiators

* **Benchmark Quality:** 9+ CGPA requirement ensures only credible tutors can officially onboard.
* **Topper-Provided Resources:** Adds trust, premium value, and motivation for juniors.
* **Reusable Content:** Toppers' notes + repeated exam question answers = goldmine for every new batch.
* **Paid Micro-Model:** Small affordable fees (₹30–₹100/session or package) → scalable.
* **Social Angle:** Students can also find peers (not just toppers) → mix of structured tutoring + collaborative study.
